At the start of a new year, it's easy to reach for ambitious goals or create a big pile of work to do. Instead, I wanted
to start with something a bit quieter: a bit of context for how I'm approaching my writing and work in 2026, and what
this blog is meant to be.

I'm committing to writing regularly this year. I tend to wait until ideas are fully formed before sharing them, and I
often hold back out of the worry about being wrong or not providing enough "value." In 2026, I'm trying something
different. I want this space to be a visible recrod of how I think, learn, and make decision while the work I'm doing is
ongoing.

This post is here to set expectations -- for you, and for me. It's also a small act of accountability, and a way to give
a clearer sense of how I show up and what I care about.

## What This Blog Is (and Isn’t)

This blog is intended to be a place for me to think in public. It's grounded in my real work: technical problems, open
source maintenance, conversations with peers, small decisions I make, and topics that I come across on the way.

Some posts will be technical in nature and carefully explained. Others will be messier; things like notes on learning
new skills or reflections on experiences. A few may take the form of longer-form posts when something feels worth
exploring more in depth.

What this blog isn't, though, is a portfolio of perfect posts or a highlight reel. Not every piece will be perfectly
polished, and not every idea will land cleanly. That's my goal. I want to show up consistently, and I want to share
where I'm at, not just the finished product.

## How I’m Approaching Writing This Year

The goal is to publish roughly once a week, but I'm deliberately keeping that flexible. Writing here is an output of the
work I'm already doing, not a separate performance layer on top of it.

Some weeks that will look like a technical deep dive or a deeper explanation of a concept I'm working through. Other
weeks it might be a few paragraphs about a decision I made, something that confused me, or a tradeoff I'm still thinking
through. Short posts count in this.

The goal is to show up consistently without turning writing into a source of pressure.

## A Few Anchors for the Year

To keep this sustainable, I’m using a small set of guiding principles as handrails.

**Consistency over intensity.**  
Showing up regularly matters more than any individual post being “important.”

**Publish thinking, not conclusions.**  
I write as a way to clarify my own thinking, and I want to share that process — not just a polished end result.

**Judgment over cleverness.**  
I’m more interested in explaining decisions and tradeoffs than in showing off tricks or novelty.

**Not everything needs to earn its place.**  
Some posts will exist because they were useful or grounding to write, not because they have some sort of deep value.

**Legibility is leverage.**  
Making my thinking understandable, to others and to future me, is more valuable than being impressive.

These aren’t hard-set rules, these are just my guiding principles.

## What You Can Expect to Read Here

Over the course of the year, you’ll likely see a mix of:

- Technical posts and deep dives
- Notes from conversations and learning experiences
- Reflections on work, learning, and mentorship
- Occasional longer essays when something needs more space

If you’re interested in how decisions get made — not just what the end result looks like — then you might find this blog
is worth visiting from time-to-time.

## A Note on Flexibility

My thinking will change over the year, and the shape of this blog may change with it. Some weeks will be lighter than
others. That’s part of this practice.

The commitment isn’t to a specific format or output level — it’s to staying present and not disappearing.
