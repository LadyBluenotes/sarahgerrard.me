For years, I’ve been closely associated with documentation work.

I've led rewrites, consulted on documentation systems, designed information architecture, and worked deep within codebases to make sure what was being written was accurate and easy to understand. 

I did this work deliberately.

Early in my dev career, I noticed how inaccessible some docs were, and how the gaps I ran into existed not because the software was inherently bad or complex, but because the surrounding knowledge was fragmented, implicit, or undocumented.

Documentation became my entry point into understanding software at a deeper level. Writing it forced me to slow down, trace behavior, and ask questions I might have otherwise glossed over. Over time, that meant reading source code instead of just APIs, digging through changelogs to understand how and why things evolved, and connecting the dots between what a system did and how it was meant to be used in practice.

That foundation is what allowed my open source contributions to grow. Docs weren’t a detour away from engineering, it was how I learned systems well enough to use them responsibly.

## When documentation shapes perception

As my work became more visible, it also started to shape how I was perceived.

Documentation was often the most public artifact of my contribution, which made it the easiest thing to associate me with. Over time, that narrowed the kinds of conversations I was pulled into, more about explanation and clarity, less about the code itself, even though the documentation itself depended on those architectural decisions.

That distinction matters. Documentation doesn’t sit outside engineering; it sits on top of it. The same judgment calls that shape a good system, such as what to expose, what to stabilize, what to leave flexible, are the ones that shape good documentation.

The work didn’t change. The signal around it did.

## The shape (and cost) of the work

Documentation work carries a particular kind of cognitive load.

To do it well, you need sustained focus: holding system behavior, edge cases, historical decisions, research, and user expectations in your head at the same time. Context switching between that mode and feature work isn’t just inefficient, it actively degrades both. Over time, I learned that trying to do everything at once wasn’t realistic.

So I handed off some engineering tasks.

Not because they were less interesting or less valuable, but because they were work others on the team were already comfortable owning. Writing documentation at the level required to make complex systems understandable was not. It required synthesis, restraint, and long stretches of uninterrupted thinking.

That effort came at a real cost.

Documentation work burned me out faster than writing code ever has. Not because it mattered less, but because it demanded constant empathy, sustained context, and the responsibility of getting things right for everyone else. You’re always thinking about the reader, the edge cases, the future version of the system, and the consequences of every word.

That experience is why I have such a clear understanding of how difficult documentation actually is. It’s not “lighter” work. It’s not something you casually tack on. When it’s done well, it asks a lot of the person doing it.

I didn’t always advocate for that reality as clearly as I should have. I trusted that the value would be obvious. But while people understood the importance of documentation, the priority and structural support rarely matched the effort required.

The result was an imbalance — one that affected both my energy and how my role was framed over time.

## Documentation requires understanding

I want to be explicit about this: documentation does not exist without understanding the code.

You can’t explain behavior you haven’t traced. You can’t describe tradeoffs you haven’t reasoned through. You can’t define things you don’t understand. Documentation is downstream of engineering work, not adjacent to it.

Software developers should be capable of writing basic documentation about the systems they work on. It doesn’t need to be perfect. It doesn’t need to be polished. Like writing in any other discipline, clarity comes through iteration. Perfection is often the enemy of something that’s simply good enough to be useful.

Being good at documentation isn’t a replacement for engineering skill, it’s a reflection of it. The ability to turn complex systems into clear explanations is a consequence of deep technical understanding.

## How this shaped my open source work

Many of my open source contributions started with documentation because that’s where I could add value thoughtfully and responsibly. That work gave me the context to spot inconsistencies, question assumptions, and understand why systems were shaped the way they were.

From there, contributions have the ability to expand naturally; you can propose changes, improve APIs, and contribute more directly to the systems themselves. Documentation gave me the foundation to do that work well, not quickly or recklessly.

The progression isn't accidental. It comes from taking the time to understand systems deeply before trying to change them.

## What I want to signal

I don’t see documentation as separate from engineering, and I don’t see my work in it as something to move past.

My contributions may not always show up as large blocks of code, but they reflect the same qualities good software development requires: technical depth, judgment, empathy for users, and an understanding of how systems evolve over time.

Documentation was where I started. It’s also one of the reasons I’m effective elsewhere.

That foundation matters and it’s part of what I bring to the table.
