Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is a crucial component of modern web design. It is a language used to
define the visual presentation of web content, including fonts, colors, layout, and other design elements.

CSS allows web developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that are accessible to all users,
including those with disabilities. In fact, accessible CSS is an essential aspect of creating a user-friendly website
since it ensures that all users can access and interact with the content in a meaningful way. In this article, we will
explore the importance of accessible CSS for a user-friendly website and provide some tips for creating accessible CSS.

## The significance of accessible CSS

Accessible CSS is a crucial aspect of creating a user-friendly website that is accessible to all users. By following
best practices and using accessible design techniques, web developers can ensure that their websites are readable,
navigable, and usable for everyone. This not only benefits people with disabilities but also improves the overall user
experience for all users.

Moreover, creating accessible CSS is essential for web applications. As more people rely on them for their daily
activities, embracing accessible CSS is crucial to provide equal access and opportunities to everyone, regardless of
their abilities.

## How do I begin?

Starting out in CSS or striving to enhance your understanding of creating web applications with better accessibility can
be overwhelming, especially for beginners. However, with dedication and perseverance, it is possible to do.

### Semantic HTML

When it comes to creating accessible CSS, there are several best practices to keep in mind. One important tip is to use
semantic HTML. By using HTML elements that provide semantic meaning, such as headings, lists, and buttons, you can
improve the accessibility of your content for assistive technologies like screen readers. You can find more information
on accessible HTML in one of
my [previous blog posts](https://blog.sarahgerrard.me/html-for-beginners-tags-and-accessibility).

### Color Contrast

Color contrast is an essential aspect of accessible CSS. Low contrast can make it difficult for users with visual
impairments to read text or differentiate between elements on a webpage. To ensure optimal color contrast, it is
recommended to use a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, such as headings.

You can use [online color contrast checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/) tools to test the
contrast ratio of your chosen color schemes and make adjustments as needed. Mozilla has
a [great article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast)
that elaborates on this topic, even going so far as to give examples and references to the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) standards. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your website is accessible to all users,
regardless of their visual abilities.

### Keyboard Accessibility

Designing for keyboard accessibility is crucial because some users with disabilities may not be able to use a mouse or
other pointing device. Ensuring that all website functions and features can be accessed and operated using only the
keyboard is essential. This includes making sure that users can navigate through the website using the Tab key and that
any interactive elements, such as forms and buttons, can be activated using the Enter key.

Some tips for creating accessibility include:

- Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and activated using the keyboard: This means making sure that all
  clickable elements, like links and buttons, can be accessed and activated using the keyboard.
- Use keyboard-friendly navigation: Users should be able to navigate through the website using only the keyboard, such
  as by using the Tab key to move between links and interactive elements.
- Provide clear focus indicators: When users navigate through the website using the keyboard, they should be able to see
  where their focus is. Make sure to provide clear focus indicators for interactive elements so that users can easily
  see where they are on the page.

### Other common practices

Here are some other common practices to keep in mind when creating accessible CSS:

- Use descriptive text for images: Adding descriptive text to images using the alt attribute ensures that users with
  visual impairments can understand the content of the image. This is also useful for users who have turned off images
  in their browser.
- Avoid using only color to convey information: Not all users can differentiate between colors, such as those who have
  color blindness, so it's important to avoid using color alone to convey important information. Instead, use different
  text styles, sizes, or icons to differentiate between different types of content.
- Provide captions and transcripts for videos: For users with hearing impairments, providing captions or transcripts for
  videos is essential. This also benefits users who may not have access to sound, such as those in noisy environments.
- Keep layouts simple and consistent: Complex or inconsistent layouts can be confusing and difficult to navigate for
  users with cognitive or learning disabilities. Keep layouts simple and consistent to ensure a smooth user experience
  for everyone.
- Test for accessibility: Finally, it's important to test your website for accessibility regularly. You can use tools
  like WAVE or Lighthouse to check your website's accessibility and make any necessary improvements.

## Accessible CSS = user-friendly website

To sum it up, accessible CSS is important if you want to create a website for everyone to use. By following some simple
tips, you can make sure that your website is readable, easy to navigate, and looks great for everyone. Not only will
this help people with disabilities, but it'll also make the website better for everyone who uses it. So, if you want to
make a website that's truly user-friendly and inclusive, make sure you're using accessible CSS!
